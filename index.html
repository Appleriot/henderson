												<p>I want to take this opportunity to thank Dr.Henderson for her editing and consulting services.<br> I am a Doctoral Candidate in Capstone I and have written the first three chapters of my manuscript.<br> It can be initially overwhelming for those who have progressed through this process.<br> However, Dr. Henderson's giftedness, collaboration, and patience have helped me to overcome apprehension and gain confidence in this first hurdle of the Capstone process.<br> Her giftedness in writing, editing, and consulting are beyond measure.<br> I am still in awe of how she assisted in helping me bridge the research data and my voice to come alive in my writing.<br> -E.T. Doctoral Candidate</p>

												<p>One night while full of frustration due to my paper being returned so my times by my mentor, I decided to post on Facebook for support and see if the returns were truly justified.<br> Dr. Henderson saw my post and messaged me.<br> Her words were of peace and encouragement.<br> I asked if I could give her a call.<br> She said yes and immediately sent me her phone number.<br> When we spoke again, she and her husband were encouraging and assured me that she would walk me through this process to get me to where I needed to be in the timeframe I had set for myself.<br> Since that first conversation, Dr. Henderson has aided me with corrections, research, prayers, and conversation.<br> She walks me step-by-step through all of my mentor’s suggestions.<br> She has examined and made the necessary edits to my paper. She has become the true guide to assisting me towards approval to begin my research.<br>
I would recommend Dr. Henderson as an Editor to anyone at any time.<br> She works diligently on your behalf and consults you every step of the way while encouraging and praying for your success.<br> -Ms. K. L., Doctoral Candidate</p>

												<p>My manuscript is now in the presence of the Director, and I thank God that I will proceed to the next phase of my Capstone process (Proposal Defense and Data Collection).<br> It is without reservation that I highly recommend the editing and consulting services of Dr.Henderson.<br> To God Be the Glory.<br> -E.T.

												<p>After several times editing my paper with my mentor and feeling defeated.<br> My mentor stopped editing my paper and recommended I consult with an editor and I did just that and here came Dr. Henderson to my rescue and eased my worries.<br> After a week and a half working with Dr. Henderson my proposal was submitted back to my mentor and days later my proposal received directors approval. <br>Importantly, editing price was reasonable.<br> Thank you Dr. Henderson!!<br>- T.W, Doctoral Candidate</p>
